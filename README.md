# Project-1

Sandra HIll Project 1

-Pizza Restaurant where you can go view the menus and send feedback comments to the restaurant.
-I created a form with 2 required fields that lets you tell the owners how you enjoyed your service.
-I used HTML and CSS to create this project. 
-What I would like to do is learn more about javascript so i can make my site more interactive.  I learned it is important to     work on one page at a time instead of bouncing around.  It made the workflow better and more understandable.
